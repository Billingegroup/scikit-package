Here are the 5 levels of sharing your code. We provide tutorials for each level.

.. include:: snippets/5-levels-table.rst

⏩️ Are you here to **start a new Python** project?

    If you are **new** to programming, start from Level 1. You will learn how to reuse code across files and folders. You will also learn how to write unit tests. To get started, visit :ref:`level-1-2-3-tutorials`.

    If you have **experience** developing scientific code in Python, we recommend starting from Level 4, where you will create a lightweight Python package with automatic formatting and unit testing using GitHub Actions. To get started, visit :ref:`level-4-tutorial`.

    If you are an **active open-source developer** and you are also familiar with GitHub Actions and forking workflows, we recommend you start from Level 5. To get started, visit :ref:`level-5-tutorial`.

⏩️ Are you here to **migrate** an existing Python project?

    Do you want to migrate your existing Python project/package to the ``scikit-package`` Level 5 ``public`` standard? To get started, visit :ref:`migrate-existing-package-to-level-5`.

    Do you want to upgrade from Level 4 to Level 5? To get started, visit :ref:`level-4-to-5-tutorial`.

⏩️ Are you here to **release** your package online?

    Do you want to streamline the release process with GitHub tags and have your package installabe with ``conda install`` and ``pip install``? To get started, visit :ref:`level-5-tutorial`.

⏩️ Do you want to explore **best practices** for developing and publishing scientific code?

    The documentation covers, among other topics, how to write effective Git commit messages and news entries used for compiling the changelog, as well as a recommended workflow for developing and requesting new features within GitHub's ecosystem. To get started, visit :ref:`billinge-group-standards`.
