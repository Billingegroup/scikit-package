Getting started
===============


- Are you here to start a new project? You can get started by creating a new lightweight Python project with ``scikit-package``. See :ref:`here <start-new-project-no-package>`.

- Are you experienced with GitHub and you are interested in turning into an installable Python package to code available locally and also distribute to the public? See :ref:`here <start-new-project-package>`.

- Are you here to standardize your existing Python package to the ``scikit-package`` standard? See :ref:`here <standardize-existing-project>`.
