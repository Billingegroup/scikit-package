- Are you here to start a new project?

    If you are **new** to programming in general, we recommend you start from Level 1-3 where you learn to reuse your scripts across files and folders.

    If you have experience in developing scientic code in Python, we recommend you start from Level 4, where you learn to turn your porject into a lightweight Python package that can be installed locally.

- Are you here to migrate your existing Python package to the ``scikit-package`` standard? See :ref:`here <standardize-existing-project>`.
