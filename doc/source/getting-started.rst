Getting started
===============

Here are the 5 levels of sharing your code. We provide tutorials for each level.

.. include:: snippets/5-levels-table.rst

- Are you here to start a new Python project?

    If you are **new** to programming in general, we recommend you start from Levels 1-3, where you learn to reuse your scripts across files and folders without the need to install anything. Start :ref:`here <tutorials-beginner>`.

    If you have **experience** in developing scientific code in Python, we recommend you start from Level 4, where you learn to turn your project into a lightweight Python package that can be installed locally. Start :ref:`here <level-4-tutorial>`.

- Do you want to **release** your code as a fully installable Python package?

    If your package is already developed with Level 4, and you are ready to release your package, let's learn to migrate from Level 4 to Level 5 and host documentation and release it to PyPI and conda-forge. Start :ref:`here <level-5-tutorial>`.

- Do you want to explore **best practices** for developing scientific code? Start :ref:`here <billinge-group-standards>`.

- Do you want to migrate your existing Python package to the ``scikit-package`` Level 5 ``public`` standard? Start :ref:`here <migration-guide>`.
