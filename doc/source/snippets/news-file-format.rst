Why do I need a news file for each PR?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to write good ``CHANGELOG.rst`` for each release version. These news items are of interest to both developers and technical users looking for specific keywords.

We can streamline the process of writing ``CHANGELOG.rst`` for each release by compiling the news items from the ``news`` directory.

Here is an example ``CHANGELOG.rst`` https://github.com/Billingegroup/scikit-package/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst

How do I write good a news item?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Do not remove ``news/TEMPLATE.rst``. Make a copy called ``<branch-name>.rst``.
- Do not modify other section headers in the rst file. Replace ``* <news item>`` only.
- For consistency, start with a capital letter and a verb. End with a period. Ex) ``Add automatic linting of .md, .yml, .rst files via prettier hook in pre-commit.``
- For trivial changes, still create ``<branch-name>.rst``, but you can use the following so that these items are ignored in the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file.
